# Group 6 Project Proposal document
### Project name: Speedboy

Speedboy is a 2D online game where the player controls a character that flips gravity to avoid obstacles and walls while 
running along a scrolling map. The game is purely for entertainment and it is targeted towards all audiences. Speedboy 
is based on Gravity Guy, a popular flash game, but with new features and a different aesthetic. Gravity Guy features 
static maps, whereas we make randomly generated maps. We will also include a customizable player character. The player 
will be able to choose how difficult the maps are generated and a menu for things such as volume level of music and sound
effects. Players can see their high score and compete with others. Their scores will be able to be submitted along with 
their profile after logging first into the database to keep a leaderboard of the best scores. Logging in the player will
have the option to create an account with a unique name checked in the database and a password, after which they will be
able to use that account for submitting scores to the before mentioned leaderboard and also saving their created character 
so they do not have to make it again. An API that can be used for this app is the Sprite.js API and possibly a login API. 
Some more ideas for the project include having a backstory, and classes and items which will affect the gameplay giving 
bonuses making some aspects of the gameplay easier. Another feature are a currency that the player will collect while playing
that they can use to buy skills or classes or items which the shop will be accessible at the main menu before the player would
start a run. This type of game has the main feature of the gameplay and many small features that help with this. Overall the 
scope of the project does not seem too small for the group as there are plenty of additional features that could be added on 
as the project progresses.
